# Homehub - Backend :house:
## Description
An application I made that will help automate certain life tasks.
Currently, the application has a few features that benefit me in personal life.
This is the backend of the application that runs the REST API.
This will allow the Whiteboard and Todolist features display.
This Application is built with the MERN stack. (Mongoose + express.js).


## Installation
Download .zip file and extract folder. On Terminal, navigate to folder directory and run 
```
npm i
```
After installation, simply run 
```
npm start
```

## Usage
Running this will simply run the _backend_ of Homehub. The backend can be found [here](https://github.com/Patoreek/Homehub).
Once started, the REST API will run and connect the routes to the frontend.
